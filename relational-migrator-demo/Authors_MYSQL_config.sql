/* Furthermore, binary logging must be enabled for MySQL replication.
* In MySQL 8.0 and higher, binary logging is enabled by default and no further configuration should be needed.
* In MySQL 5.7, binary logging must be explicitly enabled by adding the following configuration to MySQL's
* my.ini (Windows) or my.cnf (Linux/Mac) file, before restarting the service:

[mysqld]
server-id         = 1			# Set to a unique value within your topology
log_bin           = mysql-bin	# The base name of the sequence of binlog files.
binlog_format     = ROW
binlog_row_image  = FULL
expire_logs_days  = 10			# Set to desired number of days for automatic binlog file removal.

* If the source uses the NDB (clustered) database engine, the following parameters must be configured to enable CDC on tables that use that storage engine.

ndb_log_bin			    = ON
ndb_log_update_as_write = OFF	# This value prevents writing UPDATE statements as INSERT statements in the binary log.
ndb_log_updated_only  	= OFF	# This value ensures that the binary log contains the entire row and not just the changed columns.
